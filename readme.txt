Accept payments in WooCommerce with Trust Payments.

== Description ==

Website: [https://www.trustpayments.com/](https://www.trustpayments.com/)

The WooCommerce plugin offers an easy and convenient way to accept credit cards and all 
other payment methods listed below fast and securely. The payment forms will be fully integrated in your checkout 
and for credit cards there is no redirection to a payment page needed anymore. The pages are by default mobile optimized but 
the look and feel can be changed according the merchants needs.
